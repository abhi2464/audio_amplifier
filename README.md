# Audio Amplifier with Tone Control – Integrated Electronics Course Project

## 🔧 Project Overview

This project is a fully analog **Audio Amplifier** system designed and simulated as part of the *Integrated Electronics* course at IIIT Delhi. The amplifier is built using **BJT-based analog circuitry** and includes a **tone control unit** for adjusting **bass, treble, and volume**. A special feature of the design is the ability to control the **gain** dynamically by adjusting the **biasing point** of the transistors.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Three-Stage Audio Amplifier Design:**
  1. **Input Stage (Voltage Amplifier – Stage 1):**  
     - BJT in voltage divider bias and common emitter configuration  
     - Provides initial signal gain

  2. **Intermediate Stage (Voltage Amplifier – Stage 2):**  
     - Further amplifies signal for driving power stage  
     - Improves gain and impedance matching

  3. **Output Stage (Power Amplifier):**  
     - Push-pull configuration using BJT transistors  
     - Capable of driving low-impedance speakers efficiently

- **Tone Control Circuit:**  
  - Passive RC filters designed to manipulate:
    - **Bass**
    - **Treble**
    - **Volume**
  - Based on variable resistors (potentiometers)

- **Dynamic Gain Adjustment:**  
  - Implemented using an extra potentiometer  
  - Alters the bias point of BJT transistor from:
    - **Cutoff ➝ Active ➝ Saturation**, thereby tuning amplifier gain
